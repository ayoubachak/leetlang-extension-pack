# AI Leet Programming Language

![Leet Logo](media/leet_logo_256x256.png)

AI Leet is a modern, high-level programming language designed for simplicity, readability, and ease of use. It is inspired by the syntax and semantics of popular programming languages, aiming to provide a robust environment for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Features

- **Easy-to-read syntax:** Inspired by languages like Python and JavaScript.
- **Dynamic typing:** Variables can store values of any type, making the language flexible and versatile.
- **Automatic memory management:** Built-in garbage collection to handle memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Standard libraries:** A rich set of standard libraries for common tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and data manipulation.
- **Extensible:** Easily extend the language with custom libraries and modules.

```leet
// Your first AI Leet program
print "Hello, world!";
```

## Running AI Leet Programs
1) Save your .leet file.
2) Open the terminal in VSCode.
3) Navigate to the directory containing your .leet file.
4) Run the AI Leet interpreter (assuming it's installed and available in your PATH):
